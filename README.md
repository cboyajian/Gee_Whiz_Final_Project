# EDS 220 Homework 3: Group GEE_Whiz
### Calculating Mangrove Canopy Coverage

**Authors**: Allie Cole, Clarissa Boyajian, Scout Leonard

**Purpose**: This repository contains the contents of our 3rd homework assignment for EDS 220, in which we will teach a remote sensing concept to out cohort-mates. Our group calculates vegetation indices for mangrove canopies using Landsat 8 data.

**Contents**:
- **environment.yml**: Environment file for use in creating Binder environment for running Jupyter notebook
- **README.md**: This file, which contains information about repository contents and the binder to for classmates to interact with our tutorial notebook
- **mangrove_canopy_coverage.ipynb**: Julypter notebook where our data are called, described, and manipulated to analyze mangrove canopy coverage at our point of interest
- **empty_mangrove_canopy_coverage.ipynb**: a duplicate of the HW inofrmation and calculations, with code missing for live coding with the class to teach about our project 
- **A new approach for estimating mangrove canopy cover using Landsat 8 imagery.pdf**: published paper detailing a new way to calculate mangrove canopy cover using seven vegetation indeces
- **Final-Report-Cacheu-projecet-1.pdf**: report detailing restoration efforts at Cacheu River Mangroves Natural Park in Guinea-Bissau
