# EDS 220 Homework 3: Group GEE_Whiz
### Calculating Mangrove Canopy Coverage

This repository contains the contents of our 3rd homework assignment for EDS 220 assignment, in which we will teach a remote sensing concept to out cohort-mates. Our group calculates vegetation indices for mangrove canopies using Landsat 8 data. 

Contents:
- environment.yml: Template environment file for use in creating Binder environment for running Jupyter notebook
- README.md: This file, which contains information about repository contents and the binder to for classmates to interact with our tutorial notebook
- mangrove_canopy_coverage.ipynb: Julypter notebook where our data are called, described, and manipulated to analyze mangrove canopy coverage at our point of interest
- .ipynb_checkpoints/: folder containing automatically saved versions of our progress in our local repositories 
- empty_mangrove_canopy_coverage.ipynb: a duplicate of the HW inofrmation and calculations, with code missing for live coding with the class to teach about our project
